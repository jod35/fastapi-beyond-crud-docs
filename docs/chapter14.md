# Email Support

We've built many features in our application, but we intentionally skipped some that require sending emails. This allows us to dedicate a chapter to exploring email functionality in detail. Sending emails is crucial for communicating with users, verifying identities, and enabling password resets.

## FastAPI-Mail

If you're familiar with Flask, the most popular extension for adding email support is [Flask-Mail](https://flask-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Flask-Mail allows emails to be sent with a straightforward setup. The FastAPI equivalent is [FastAPI-Mail](https://sabuhish.github.io/fastapi-mail/), which has a similar configuration process but also supports asynchronous operations and Pydantic models.

Let's begin by installing FastAPI-Mail. In your terminal, within the active virtual environment, install it with:

```console
$ pip install fastapi-mail
```

## Configuring FastAPI-Mail

Let's create a file to set up FastAPI-Mail and centralize all email-sending logic. Inside the `src/` directory, create a file called `mail.py` and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi_mail import FastMail, ConnectionConfig, MessageSchema, MessageType
from src.config import Config
from pathlib import Path


# get the parent directory
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent


# create the config for sending emails
mail_config = ConnectionConfig(
    MAIL_USERNAME=Config.MAIL_USERNAME,
    MAIL_PASSWORD=Config.MAIL_PASSWORD,
    MAIL_FROM=Config.MAIL_FROM,
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_SERVER=Config.MAIL_SERVER,
    MAIL_FROM_NAME=Config.MAIL_FROM_NAME,
    MAIL_STARTTLS=True,
    MAIL_SSL_TLS=False,
    USE_CREDENTIALS=True,
    VALIDATE_CERTS=True,
    TEMPLATE_FOLDER=Path(BASE_DIR, "templates"),
)


# create the object to send emails with the config
mail = FastMail(config=mail_config)

def create_message(recipients: list[str], subject: str, body: str):
    message = MessageSchema(
        recipients=recipients, subject=subject, body=body, subtype=MessageType.html
    )
    return message
```

### Explanation

We begin by importing `FastMail`, `ConnectionConfig`, `MessageSchema`, and `MessageType`.

```python title="The imports"
from fastapi_mail import FastMail, ConnectionConfig, MessageSchema, MessageType
from src.config import Config
from pathlib import Path
```

- `FastMail`: Creates the `mail` object for accessing email-sending methods.
- `ConnectionConfig`: Sets up the email configuration for FastAPI-Mail.
- `MessageSchema`: Structures an email before sending.
- `MessageType`: Specifies the type of content to send via email (e.g., HTML).
- `Config`: Imports application-specific configurations, including email settings.
- `Path`: Used to create paths, particularly for determining the location of the templates folder.

We then proceed to configure FastAPI-Mail using values we get from our `Config` object.

```python title="email config"
mail_config = ConnectionConfig(
    MAIL_USERNAME=Config.MAIL_USERNAME,
    MAIL_PASSWORD=Config.MAIL_PASSWORD,
    MAIL_FROM=Config.MAIL_FROM,
    MAIL_PORT=587,
    MAIL_SERVER=Config.MAIL_SERVER,
    MAIL_FROM_NAME=Config.MAIL_FROM_NAME,
    MAIL_STARTTLS=True,
    MAIL_SSL_TLS=False,
    USE_CREDENTIALS=True,
    VALIDATE_CERTS=True,
    TEMPLATE_FOLDER=Path(BASE_DIR, "templates"),
)
```

| `TEMPLATE_FOLDER` | Specifies the folder containing email templates, useful for sending HTML emails with Jinja templates. we set this up to make use of `BASE_DIR` to point to a `templates` folder we should have in our `src` |

The `mail` object is created using the `FastMail` class and is configured with `mail_config`:

```python
mail = FastMail(config=mail_config)
```

A function `create_message` is defined to create an email message. It takes `recipients`, `subject`, and `body` as parameters and returns a `MessageSchema` object:

```python
def create_message(recipients: list[str], subject: str, body: str):
    message = MessageSchema(
        recipients=recipients, subject=subject, body=body, subtype=MessageType.html
    )
    return message
```

In the `Settings` class located in `src.config.py`, email-related configuration variables are added. These variables are used to configure the email sending settings:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    DATABASE_URL: str
    JWT_SECRET: str
    JWT_ALGORITHM: str
    REDIS_HOST: str
    REDIS_PORT: str
    # add these
    MAIL_USERNAME: str
    MAIL_PASSWORD: str
    MAIL_FROM: str
    MAIL_PORT: int
    MAIL_SERVER: str
    MAIL_FROM_NAME: str
    MAIL_STARTTLS: bool = True
    MAIL_SSL_TLS: bool = False
    USE_CREDENTIALS: bool = True
    VALIDATE_CERTS: bool = True
    DOMAIN: str
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env", extra="ignore")
```

The `.env` file should be updated with the relevant environment variables for email configuration:

```console
DATABASE_URL=<your postgresql url>
JWT_SECRET=<your jwt secret>
JWT_ALGORITHM=<your jwt algorithm>
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

MAIL_USERNAME=<your mail username>
MAIL_PASSWORD=<your mail password>
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_FROM=<your email address>
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Bookly

DOMAIN=localhost:8000
```

!!! Note
    The `DOMAIN` environment variable shall be set to help us when we create the verification and password reset
    links.

### Sending Our First Email

To send an email, all we shall have to do is to call the `send_message` method on the `mail` object. Let us do that in `src/auth/routes.py
`.

```python title="sending emails"
.... # rest of the imports
from src.mail import mail, create_message
from src.celery_tasks import send_email
from src.auth.schemas import EmailModel

auth_router = APIRouter()


@auth_router.post("/send_mail")
async def send_mail(emails: EmailModel):
    emails = emails.addresses

    html = "<h1>Welcome to the app</h1>"
    subject = "Welcome to our app"

    message = create_message(recipients=emails, subject=subject, body=html)
    mail.send_message(message)

    return {"message": "Email sent successfully"}
```

To send an email, we'll utilize the `send_message` method within the `mail` object. This code will reside in the `src/auth/routes.py` file.

We've constructed an API endpoint accessible at the `/auth/send_mail` path. Its corresponding handler function is named `send_mail`. This function accepts an `EmailModel` object as input, which contains a list of email addresses intended for the email. 

We extract these addresses from the `EmailModel` object. A basic HTML structure  `html` and a `subject` line are defined for the email content. Subsequently, the `create_message` function is invoked, providing the `recipient` `email` `addresses`, subject, and HTML content. This function generates a message object which is then passed to the mail.send_message method to dispatch the email. A success message is returned to indicate successful email transmission.

The `EmailModel` class, located in `src/auth/schemas.py`, is a Pydantic model designed to validate the incoming email addresses. It mandates a list of email strings within the addresses field.

```python title="pydantic model for getting recipient email addresses"
class EmailModel(BaseModel):
    addresses : List[str]

```


Hereâ€™s the revised text with improved grammar and language:

---

Let us test this. Accessing the endpoint and making a request results in the following response:

![Successful email is sent](./img/img57.png)

To confirm if our email has been sent:

![Confirming if the email is sent](./img/img58.png)

!!! Note
    You may notice a slight delay between the sending of the emails and the response indicating that an email has been successfully sent. This is because, to send the email, we are making another request to the SMTP server we use. We will explore an approach to speed this up in a later chapter.

## User Account Verification
If you have followed this series from the beginning, you will notice that we created a user authentication database model called `User`. In this model, we defined the `is_verified` field to handle the activation of user accounts. We will start by implementing this verification process using the email address provided by the user during signup.

User account verification is important as it prevents the creation of fake accounts. It also allows us to collect user email addresses for communications and other purposes.

### ItsDangerous
To safely move data from our server to an untrusted environment, we will use [ItsDangerous](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/). ItsDangerous is a Python package that allows us to cryptographically sign data and hand it over to someone else, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with when we receive it. The recipient of the data can receive and read it but cannot modify it unless they have the sender's secret key.

This package will be crucial as it will enable us to create URL-safe tokens that we will include in the user verification links we send via email.

To install it we shall run
```console
$ pip install itsdangerous
```

To set it up, let us navigate to `src/auth/utils.py` and add the following code.

```python title="serializing and deserializing user's email address"
... #rest of the imports

from itsdangerous import URLSafeTimedSerializer

... # rest of the code 

serializer = URLSafeTimedSerializer(
    secret_key=Config.JWT_SECRET, salt="email-configuration"
)

def create_url_safe_token(data: dict):
    """Serialize a dict into a URLSafe token"""

    token = serializer.dumps(data)

    return token

def decode_url_safe_token(token:str):
    """Deserialize a URLSafe token to get data"""
    try:
        token_data = serializer.loads(token)

        return token_data
    
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(str(e))
        
```
In the above code, we begin by importing the `URLSafeTimedSerializer` class that will allow us to create the `serializer` object we shall use to serialize the user's email address. We configure it using the `secret_key` that comes from the same secret key we used to create our access tokens and provide a `salt` which we keep to the string of "email-verification".

After that, we then create two functions `create_url_safe_token` and `decode_url_safe_token` . The first function is responsible for serializing the `data` dictionary into a `token`.

The second function allows us to deserialize a token so that we get the data, also catching any errors that may occur.
